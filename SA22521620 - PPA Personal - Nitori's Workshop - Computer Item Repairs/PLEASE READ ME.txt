I didn't have enough system resources to run Intellij Idea,
so I wrote the code in VSCode and compiled it manually.

If there is a need to run the server the same way I did.

1. Extract the server files in the folder.

2. CD or open a terminal in that folder, (the server files with the SERVER.jar)
and run this command.

3. "java -jar server.jar" -> This will run the server.

(Please have the DB running, or spring won't work!)

For the client APP.
You can run with 'npm start'

Thank you!
